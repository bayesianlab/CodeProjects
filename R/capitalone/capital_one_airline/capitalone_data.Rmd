# Quick Overview
- The top five flights are DFW-OGG, EWR-SFO, HNL-SFO, HNL-IAH, ATL-HNL. These would be my recommendations as they would provide the most profit in the shortest amount of time. 
- The top flights for profitability are different than the busiest flights. 
- Key metrics to track: profitability, average delays, ticket fares, break even flights, and airport size.
