MATLAB is a high-level language and program for manipulating matrices.
It can be used as a commandline interface or GUI.
NB: Native MATLAB uses 1 license per core and is meant to be used
interactively for short times (<1 hour).  

IT IS NOT MEANT TO BE INVOKED ON MULTIPLE INSTANCES ON COMPUTE NODES.
Please see <http://goo.gl/XZRYs> for the proper way to compile your 
m-code into executables for long runs which will not require a license.

FAILURE TO CONVERT YOUR CODE TO m-code MAY RESULT IN JOBS BEING KILLED
IF RUNNING MULTIPLE INSTANCES AND NOT ON AN INTERACTIVE NODE. Ask for
help if you need it -  hpc-support@uci.edu

To check the number of used licenses for a particular toolbox,
 use the following command from one of the login nodes:

   /data/apps/matlab/R2018a/etc/glnxa64/lmutil lmstat -a -c \
   1711@flexlm2.oit.uci.edu | grep <name of toolbox>

Index in position 1 exceeds array bounds (must not exceed 720).
