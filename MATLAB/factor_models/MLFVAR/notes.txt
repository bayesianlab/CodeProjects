Submitted kose_fullT which is Kose's model on the full T
observations of the data. For comparison to the new method, 
the ML should be less than the new method. 

Submitted constant_only which is my model using only a constant.
 This should bring back the world factor. 

Submitted aer_rep which is the attempt at repclicating Koses results
from his 2003 AER paper. 

Submitted eff_fac which is Kose's method using my model,
for comparison of efficiency factors. Does not 
compute ML.

All Kose Replication studies are wrong. They were compiled using RunHdfvar.m on accident.
All other results are suspect because yt was standardized but not Xt.
This seems to have no effect on the variance decompositions, but it should be rerun 
so that he coefficients are not suspiciously large. 

Priors were adjusted and runhdfvar was recompiled to reflect that. Priors on 
Factor variance should be sufficiently large so that large loadings do not need 
to be fit. 

runbaseline_AER_REP is compiled RunBaseline.m
