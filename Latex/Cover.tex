	\opening{Dear Professor Bauer,}

		
		I am currently finishing my PhD in Economics at UC Irvine where I focus on econometrics and macroeconomics. I expect to complete my doctorate in June, 2020.  As a Macroeconomist, my research focuses on global financial markets. I am applying for this position because I am seeking opportunities to continue my research in Macrofinance. 

My most recent work focuses on the estimation of hierarchical dynamic factor time series models and model selection. I develop a more efficient Bayesian method to estimate these models by reducing the number of Monte Carlo runs needed to sample from the posterior. In addition, I argue that improvements can be made to the model by including observables, which are difficult to implement using the traditional Principal Components framework. Furthermore, I also provide a Bayesian model selection technique to find structural breakpoints in the parameters.

The positive benefits from the improvement in sampling efficiency as well as the differences in modeling opens up a wide venue of other research I am pursuing. Previous studies using these models have not employed my improved sampler nor modeling improvements. This offers many opportunities to improve upon work where these models are applied such as financial markets, monetary policy, and housing markets. I also have several papers in different states of development dealing with nonlinear models, instrumental variables, and model selection in settings with truncated parameter spaces. 

Additionally, I bring extensive experience in the classroom to this postdoctoral position. Since beginning my PhD I have been a teaching assistant and taught almost every undergraduate class UC Irvine offers to economics majors including Macroeconomics, Finance, and Econometrics. I have been able to also instruct my own courses at UC Irvine and at my previous employment. I also have experience teaching graduate courses since I am currently the teaching assistant to Professor Ivan Jeliazkov for the graduate econometrics course.   

Enclosed is my curriculum vitae and contact information for my references.  All of my most recent work and
presentations are available at:

My graduate work has prepared me with strong applied econometric skills. I have learned many coding languages like Python, R, MATLAB and C++, and their respective data processing packages. My coursework also particularly prepares me for this post-doctoral position as I have taken courses on Macro-finance and taught courses on stocks, options and other derivatives. I look forward to bringing my skills and working with others at Universit\"{a}t Hamburg.  Thank you for your consideration.
